Application deployed successfully to production

User documentation complete

## Implementation Status: COMPLETED

### Entities Created:
1. **Role** - Represents user roles for role-based access control
2. **Permission** - Represents fine-grained permissions
3. **AuditLog** - Represents security audit logs for tracking user actions

### Services Implemented:
1. **SecurityService** - Managing roles, permissions, authentication, and audit logging

### API Endpoints:
1. **Role Management**
   - POST /roles - Create a new role
   - GET /roles - List all roles

2. **Permission Management**
   - POST /permissions - Create a new permission
   - GET /permissions - List all permissions
   - POST /roles/:id/permissions - Assign permissions to a role

3. **User Management**
   - POST /users/:id/role - Assign role to a user

4. **Authentication**
   - POST /auth/login - User login with email and password
   - POST /auth/reset-password/request - Request password reset
   - POST /auth/reset-password/confirm - Confirm password reset

### Features:
- Role-based access control (RBAC) system
- Fine-grained permission management
- User authentication with JWT tokens
- Password reset functionality
- Security audit logging with user tracking
- User session management
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Company-based security management

### Technology Stack:
- **TypeORM** for database management
- **TypeScript/Node.js** for backend services
- **PostgreSQL** for data storage
- **REST API** for security endpoints
- **bcrypt** for password hashing
- **jsonwebtoken** for JWT token management

### Security Measures:
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Fine-grained permission system
- Security audit logging
- Password reset with time-limited tokens
- User session tracking
